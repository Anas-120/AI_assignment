Write Prolog programs to complete the following questions:

1. A popular children’s riddle is “Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man’s father is my father’s son.” Use the rules of the family domain (Section 8.3.2 on page 301 in the Textbook) to find who that man is using a Prolog program.

2. A man, a woman and two children had to go to the opposite bank of a river using a boat.The man and the woman weighed 80 kg each and the children weighed 30 kg each. Given that the boat can carry upto 100 kg and that everyone can drive a boat, write a Prolog program to find how all four can cross the river with the boat. You may refer to
